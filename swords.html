    <h3>Sandai Kitetsu</h3>
    <p>Sandai Kitetsu is one of the Wazamono blade swords, also known as Grade Swords. It was first introduced to the fans during the Logue Town arc of the series, where Zoro picked it up from a barrel after sensing sinister energy coming from it. Sandai Kitetsu belongs to the family of the Kitetsu swords and thus, is a Cursed Sword. This sword is extremely difficult to control due to its thirst for blood, however, what's even more dangerous is that it brings a terrible death upon whoever wields it.</p>

    <h3>Yubashiri</h3>
    <p>Yubashiri is another blade that Roronoa Zoro got his hands on during the Logue Town arc of the series. After displaying his courage and testing his luck against the curse of Sandai Kitetsu, Ipponmatsu was extremely impressed with him and thus decided to gift Yubashiri to him. Known to be a very light blade, Yubashiri was the exact opposite of the Sandai Kitetsu and according to Zoro, was very easy to control. Despite it being very light, its edge was said to be very sharp, however, Zoro didn't have much trouble getting used to it.
      Yubashiri was a fine blade, however, Zoro lost it during the Enies Lobby arc of One Piece when he faced Shu, a man with the powers of the Rust Rust Fruit.</p>

    <h3>Wado Ichimonji</h3>
    <p>Wado Ichimonji is the first named sword that Roronoa Zoro carried in One Piece. It was forged by Shimotsuki Kozaburou, a person from Wano Country. This sword once belonged to Koushiro, the dojo master of Zoro from Shimotsuki village, and was meant to be inherited by Kuina, his daughter. After her death, Roronoa Zoro asked for the sword to be able to carry the promise that he made to Kuina and become the best swordsman in the entire world.</p>

    <h3>Enma</h3>
    <p>Also forged by Shimotsuki Kozaburo, Enma is an incredibly powerful sword that also belongs to the class of 21 O Wazamono grade swords. It was first wielded by Kozuki Oden, the Daimyo of Wano Country's Kuri region, alongside another blade of the same class, known as Ame no Habakiri. Together, Oden used the two blades to perform 'Oden Nitoryu,' a powerful style that he described to be best in the entire world.</p>

    <h3>shusui</h3>
    <p>nother one of the 21 O Wazamono grade swords, Shusui was once the blade of the "Sword God" Shimotsuki Ryuma. Using this very blade, Ryuma was able to slice off a dragon's head in Wano Country, and that's known to be just one of the many great things that he's accomplished over the years. After his death, it was in the possession of his Zombie who, after being defeated by Roronoa Zoro at Thriller Bark, gave it to him as a sign of respect for his way of the sword. Due to the regular imbuement of Armament Haki over the years, Ryuma was able to turn his sword permanently black, thus earning the title of "Kokuto."</p>
